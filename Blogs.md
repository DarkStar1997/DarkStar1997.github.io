I love to share my learnings with my friends. Here are a few blogs I have written:-

1. [Intermediate C++: Speeding up iostreams in C++](https://dasayan05.github.io/blog-tut/2019/04/06/speeding-up-iostreams-in-c++.html)

	We often come across situations where we need to process large files. Clearly interactive input-output is not helpful in all situations. It is a common practice to use cin and cout for input-output in C++ because of it’s flexibility and ease of use. But there is quite a big problem with iostream, which is by default, much slower than standard IO functions in other languages. In this tutorial, I will quantitatively demonstrate the slowness of iostreams in C++, explain some of the reasons for its slowness and share some tips to speed it up.

1. [Intermediate C++: Static and Dynamic linking](https://dasayan05.github.io/blog-tut/2019/01/05/linking-in-c++.html)

	C++ is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language designed/developed by Bjarne Stroustrup which alongwith C, forms the backbone of majority of the programming industry today. A very important concept to be grasped by beginner programmers is the idea of “linking”. Linking basically refers to the process of bundling library code into an archive and use it later when necessary. It turns out to be an idea that is used extensively in production. The following article aims at presenting a broad view of “linking”.
