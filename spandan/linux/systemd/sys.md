The Linux world has changed rapidly in the past few years. It has become beginner friendly with proper hardware support requiring little or no technical knowledge to get up and running. There are several distributions out there Debian, Fedora , Arch Linux, Gentoo, Solus, Clear OS, Gentoo and many more. One thing that most of these distros have in common is *Systemd* (Gentoo primarily supports and ecourages OpenRC but has systemd profiles as well). My 11 years of linux usage has taught me to both respect and hate systemd and today hopefully I can convince you of the same.<br/>
