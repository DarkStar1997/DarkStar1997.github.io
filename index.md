# Welcome!!!

Hi, My name is Rohan Mark Gomes. I am a final year student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://iemcse.wordpress.com/) pursuing *B.Tech* at [Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata](http://iem.edu.in/). It has been an honor to be a part of the [IEM Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cell](http://iedc.iemecell.com/), funded by the [Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India](http://www.dst.gov.in/) since *August 2017*. Being a part of IEM-IEDC, I have also earned priceless opportunities to play an active part in numerous research projects involving the latest technology in the field of Deep Learning, Computer Vision and High Performance Computing. I am an aspiring **High Performance Computing** Engineer, **Deep Learning** enthusiast, **C++** lover, **Linux** fanboy and also a [Dota 2](http://www.dota2.com/international/battlepass/) addict with more than 775 hours of gameplay.
