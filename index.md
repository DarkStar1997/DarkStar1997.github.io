Hi, My name is Rohan Mark Gomes. I am a final year student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://iemcse.wordpress.com/) pursuing *B.Tech* at [Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata](http://iem.edu.in/). I am also a part of the [IEM Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cell](http://iedc.iemecell.com/) since *August 2017*. I have been an active part of numerous research projects involving the latest technology in the field of Deep Learning, Computer Vision and High Performance Computing. I am an aspiring **High Performance Computing** Engineer, **Deep Learning** enthusiast, **C++** lover, **Linux** fanboy and also a [Dota 2](http://www.dota2.com/international/battlepass/) addict with more than 570 hours of gameplay.
