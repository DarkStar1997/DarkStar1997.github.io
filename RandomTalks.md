*	Youtube video demonstrating GMP C++

	In this video I have demonstrated the usage of the [GMP library](https://gmplib.org/) side by side with the BigInteger library in JAVA. Please be mindful of the fact that this video was uploaded a long time ago in my first year of college when I still used Windows as my primary OS.

*	My Arch Linux with i3 setting:

	Being a Linux fanboy, I like fine-tuning my workspace to suit my needs. I use Arch Linux with i3 as my window manager. Here's a screenshot of my setting.
