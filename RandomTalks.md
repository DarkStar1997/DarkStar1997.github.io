In this page I will be adding random stuff which might be of interest to you.

*	Me playing guitar when I was a child (probably in class 5 or younger)

*	Youtube video demonstrating GMP C++

	In this video I have demonstrated the usage of the [GMP library](https://gmplib.org/) side by side with the BigInteger library in JAVA. Please be mindful of the fact that this video was uploaded a long time ago in my first year of college when I still used Windows as my primary OS.
